1. However, liability for the violation of essential contractual obligations shall be limited to the foreseeable damage typical for the contract. Liability for indirect damages, consequential damages, loss of profit and other financial losses is expressly excluded.

1. HicknHack Software is expressly not liable for damages, the occurrence of which the Licensee could have prevented through appropriate, reasonable measures, in particular data and program backups. In all other respects, liability for loss of data is limited to the typical recovery costs that would have been incurred if backups had been made on a regular basis and at the appropriate level of risk. 

1. The provisions stated herein shall also apply in favor of the legal representatives, executive employees and other vicarious agents of HicknHack Software.

1. Liability under the Product Liability Act remains unaffected.

1. All agreements that contain an amendment, supplement or concretization of these contractual conditions as well as special assurances and agreements must be made in writing.

1. Should any provision of this License Agreement be invalid, this shall not affect the legal validity of the remaining provisions. In place of the invalid provision, a valid provision shall be deemed to have been agreed which most closely approximates the economic intent of the parties. The same shall apply to the filling of a gap.

1. With regard to all legal relationships arising from this contractual relationship, the parties agree that the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply, excluding the conflict of laws provisions and the provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
